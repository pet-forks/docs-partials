HAProxy is not configured to support HTTP/2 ingress traffic
nor does it send HTTP/2 traffic to Gorouter,
even when HTTP/2 is enabled.

Environments wishing to support HTTP/2 traffic
can use an external load balancer as described in
[Supporting HTTP/2](../adminguide/supporting-http2.html#load-balancer).

This issue should be resolved in a future patch version.
